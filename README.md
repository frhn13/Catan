# Catan Game

This is a Catan game where users can play again each-other over a LAN connection. One person must run GameServer.java
and then all the users can run Main.java and enter the IP address of the computer running the server on the LAN connection.
After this the game board will be displayed and the game can begin once all four users have connected to the server.

Currently, this project includes all the features of Catan, other than development cards, ports and longest road/largest
army.
